# Smile to Animate

Smile to Animate is a simple project designed to run an animation when you smile. Using open source code from OpenCV, the smile detector will open an animation and play it. When no smile is detected the animation stops.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo.

### Prerequisites

This app was developed in Python 3. It is recommended to use a virtual environment when installing Python packages on your system.

The main dependency is `opencv-python`. Install it using your favorite package manager.

You'll also need to use your own animation. Download an animation into the root directory and edit `line 29` of `smile.py` accordingly.

### Installing

To start the app, from the project root:
`python smile.py`

Once loaded, just smile!

To quit, just press 'q'.
